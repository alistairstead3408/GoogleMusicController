GoogleMusicController
=====================
Inspired by [Blatherberg](http://blatherberg.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/google-music-keyboard-control-on-osx/)

Currently just any open Google Music tab in safari to the foreground. 

#Running
To run from the terminal do:
```
osascript source.applescript
```

I would recommend that you just drag the app into the dock and run it from there. 

#Goal

Hopefully link apple keyboard play buttons to Google Music.
